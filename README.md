# 2048Solver

This program uses Selenium WebDriver API to interact with the 2048 puzzle online -- not only to simulate arrow keys to actually play the game, but also to access online local storage the 2048 puzzle uses to store the game state after each move. This allows the algorithm to know the state of each tile after each move to best decide where to go next.
