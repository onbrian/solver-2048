# 2048Solver

This program uses Selenium WebDriver API to interact with the 2048 puzzle online. 

Not only does it use Selenium WebDriver to simulate arrow keys to play the game, but also to access
the local storage the game uses to store the game state after each move. This allow the algorithm to
know the state of each tile after each move to next decide where to go next.
